<h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hey there, I'm Ahmed Fkih! I'm currently studying Computer Science in Italy,
    and I absolutely love it! My passion for coding and building applications 
    started when i was as little as 5, when my dad introduced me to this world, 
    and I've been hooked ever since. Whether I'm working on a personal project 
    or collaborating with others, I'm always excited to see what we can create together.
    <br/><br/>
    Aside from coding, I'm also a huge gamer. I've been playing games for as long 
    as I can remember, and I love exploring different genres and platforms. From 
    console games to pc games, I'm always on the lookout for something new and exciting.
    <br/><br/>
    When I'm not coding or gaming, I'm watching anime or reading a manga. 
    One culture that has always fascinated me is Japan. I'm particularly interested in their 
    food, art, and technology. One day, I hope to visit Japan and immerse myself in their unique culture.
