  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <p>
    One of my biggest passions is building things. Whenever I come across 
    an interesting object or device, I always wonder how it works and how 
    it was put together. And once I figure it out, I love to try building it myself.
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a big fan of DIY projects and enjoy building things from scratch. 
    Some of my favorite projects include building custom keyboards, my phone, 
    my pc, making my own furniture, apps and websites. One of my most recent and exciting projects 
    was building a custom smart mirror, which i'm still working on it 
    <i>
      (the problem with DIY is that the pieces you need the most are the ones 
      that take the longest to arrive XD).
    </i> 
    <br/><br/>
    I also enjoy learning new skills and techniques for building things.
    I'm always looking for new challenges and projects to work on. 
    One of my long-term goals is to build my own smart home with all 
    my automation system built by me using Raspberry Pi and other open-source tools.
    <br/><br/>
    Overall, building things is a huge part of my life and brings me a lot 
    of joy and satisfaction. I love the feeling of creating something with 
    my own hands and seeing it come to life. It's a hobby that allows me to 
    express my creativity and constantly challenge myself to learn new things.
