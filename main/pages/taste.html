  <h1>My taste</h1>
  <p>
    In addition to building things and gaming, I have a 
    variety of interests and hobbies that make up who I am. 
    One of the things that define my personality is my taste 
    in different areas. From Music to VideoGames, I have my 
    own unique preferences that reflect my personality and style.

    Here are some of my favorite things in different categories:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Music:</b> I listen mostly to <strong>Lo-Fi music</strong>
